## Similiarity Example 1

generated_output.wav was generated by the model. These were the three most similar examples (scores below). The generated bar sounds pretty different from the first bars of the training examples, though the metric seems to be working as these are likely the closest beats in the input distribution to the generated beat. The generated beat should be compared to the first bars of the downsampled training beats, as that's what the model produces.
